# Agent Protocol v2: Multi-session runtimes

Protocol v2 allows one Agent process to serve multiple isolated database sessions. Pooled JDBC Agents that use the common structured error producer advertise `protocolVersion: 2`, `multi_session`, and `structured_error_v1`. Generic/custom v2 handlers may advertise only `multi_session`. DBX falls back to the v1 one-process-per-pool lifecycle when `multi_session` is absent.

## Session lifecycle

- `open_session` creates one logical database session. Parameters contain the normal connection fields plus `agentSessionId` and an optional `sessionRole`.
- Every connection-scoped RPC contains `agentSessionId`.
- `validate_session` validates and, where supported, reconnects only that session.
- `cancel_session` cancels active statements and cursor fetches for only that session; other sessions in the runtime continue normally.
- `close_session` closes the session resources, query cursors, and table-read cursors without affecting other sessions.
- `shutdown` closes all sessions and terminates the runtime.

`agentSessionId` identifies a logical database connection. Existing `sessionId` fields remain pagination cursor identifiers and must not be used as logical connection identifiers.

`sessionRole` is `workload` by default. DBX sends `metadata` for object-tree, completion, and other read-only metadata sessions. New runtimes use this role to preserve metadata checkout capacity; older runtimes may ignore the field.

## Concurrency

Requests for different sessions may execute concurrently. Requests for the same session are serialized because connection state, transactions, schema changes, and driver connections are not generally safe for concurrent use. JSON-RPC responses may be returned out of order and are correlated by request `id`.

All Java JDBC runtimes share HikariCP pools by immutable connection identity through `AbstractJdbcAgent`. Stateless requests borrow and return connections. Paged cursors and explicit session-state SQL pin a connection to the logical session, and stateful connections are evicted when that session closes so state cannot leak across sessions. Custom URL construction, transport fallback, connection initialization, and native-driver access remain behind shared lifecycle hooks.

DBX uses unique short-lived logical sessions for independent Agent metadata tasks so they do not queue behind editor execution. These sessions close after completion, and cancellation-safe cleanup closes them when the caller is dropped.

## Runtime compatibility

Runtime reuse keys include the Agent driver key, executable or JAR path, launch arguments, working directory, JRE selection, JVM options, classpath-affecting options, and native executable version boundary. Host, account, schema, and credentials belong to sessions and are not part of the runtime key.

Etcd and ZooKeeper retain the legacy path because they use the key-value Agent protocol rather than the SQL session contract. Older Agent binaries and JARs also remain on the legacy path.

## Resource limits and recovery

A runtime accepts at most 256 logical sessions. Closing the final session starts a 30-second grace period before the process exits, preventing rapid tab open/close cycles from repeatedly starting a runtime. Process EOF fails all pending requests; the failed runtime is removed from reuse and recreated on demand. Connection validation and reconnect operate on a single logical session.

JSON-RPC failures may include structured recovery data:

```json
{
  "contractVersion": 1,
  "category": "timeout|canceled|connection|protocol|resource|sql",
  "retryable": false,
  "sessionDisposition": "keep|quarantine|replace_runtime",
  "agentSessionId": "optional-session-id",
  "stage": "request|checkout|connect|validate|execute|fetch|cancel|close",
  "operationOutcome": "not_started|unknown",
  "sqlState": "optional-jdbc-sql-state",
  "vendorCode": 0,
  "exceptionClass": "optional-java-exception-class"
}
```

`contractVersion: 1` is guaranteed only when the handshake advertises `structured_error_v1`. Unknown extra fields are allowed, but unknown enum values, missing required fields, invalid types, or an `agentSessionId` that does not match the current request are contract violations. `operationOutcome` describes whether the user operation may have reached the database; `retryable` is an internal hint and never authorizes automatic SQL replay.

`keep` preserves the logical session, `quarantine` removes only that session from routing, and `replace_runtime` requires DBX to atomically remove every pool sharing the runtime before terminating it. Agent code reports the disposition but must not independently terminate a shared runtime because it does not own DBX routing state. Temporary workload checkout backpressure uses `category=resource`, `retryable=true`, and `sessionDisposition=keep`; only unrecoverable runtime or cleanup saturation requests `replace_runtime`.

The complete JDBC pool checkout runs under a bounded runtime executor, including HikariCP idle-connection validation, physical connection creation, and driver setup. Workload admission, the runtime-wide physical connection budget, physical creation, and checkout consume one absolute deadline rather than restarting the timeout at each stage. Connection return, eviction, and physical close use separate bounded executors so they cannot deadlock checkout or creation. If a driver call outlives its boundary, or cleanup cannot confirm the physical connection state, the connection identity is poisoned and returns `category=resource` with `sessionDisposition=replace_runtime` on the current or next checkout. A late connection must be evicted and closed instead of published, and DBX must not replay the timed-out user operation automatically.

## Driver author guidance

Use `MultiSessionJsonRpcServer(YourAgent::new)` for Java SQL Agents so each logical session receives a new `DatabaseAgent` with isolated connection state. The shared runtime owns the physical JDBC pools. Do not store connection, statement, cursor, transaction, or schema state in static mutable fields. Use the session execution context for paged query resources. Native Agents must provide equivalent per-session state and synchronized stdout writes.

The Xugu native Agent keeps one database connection per logical session plus one shared control connection per database endpoint. Because `go-xugu-driver` does not interrupt network reads through `context.Context`, cancellation records the server-side session ID and calls `DBMS_DBA.KILL_SESSION_TRANS` through the shared control connection.
